# Worked-out Example: StudyPlanner 
In this worked-out example, we present parts of the solution for the project _StudyPlanner_. The program _StudyPlanner_ is a software management tool that supports students to plan their curriculum and provides statistics about the progress and average grade.

An extended description of the project's requirements can be found in the task text below.

## Task Text
The task is to develop a software management tool for planning a curriculum. The user should be able to manage their courses, which means to create, modify, and delete a course and especially assign a course to a semester. 
A course always has a name, exam date, and grade.
For the planning of the remaining curriculum, the toll should provide statistical data like the number of credit points for a semester, the number of collected credit points, and the current average grade.
The program must store all entered data and load them when the program is launched.
